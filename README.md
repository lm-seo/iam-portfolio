# Security Operations Portfolio (Non-SOC)
## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on preparation for a Security Operations / Security Administrator role in a non-SOC corporate environment.

The focus is day-to-day security operations, not threat hunting or SOC monitoring.
All exercises, procedures, and documents are designed to reflect real tasks performed in internal IT security teams within small-to-medium organizations.

This portfolio demonstrates that I can operate from day one, following established processes, applying least privilege, supporting audits, and handling common security incidents in a controlled and documented way.
